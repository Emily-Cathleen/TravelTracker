# Challenges and Wins
A challenge and win in this project was learning how to use API fetch calls and drilling into the data to get the information we need. The charts.js, getting charts to display were both a challenge and a win. Posting to the API was a win for the team.

# Future Additions
- User receives randomized activity prompt to encourage good habits.
- User interation, ability to pick a date.
- After user inputs data for the day, make page refresh to show current data.
- Sad path testing.
